/**
 * This module exports collections specialized for use in the JasperDB VirtualDataSource
 * implementation. Except for the {@link com.swirlds.jasperdb.collections.ThreeLongsList}, the main
 * design constraint is to maximize performance while preserving safety given the concurrent usage
 * patterns of JasperDB.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of {@link com.swirlds.jasperdb.collections.HashList} and {@link
 * com.swirlds.jasperdb.collections.LongList} behave as simple maps with {@code long} keys. The
 * {@link com.swirlds.jasperdb.collections.ImmutableIndexedObjectList} provides a copy-on-write list
 * that maintains the self-reported order of a collection of {@link
 * com.swirlds.jasperdb.collections.IndexedObject}s.
 *
 * <p>Since JasperDB typically only needs {@code long} keys in a contiguous numeric range starting
 * from some minimum value, there is also a theme of reducing memory usage by not allocating storage
 * for list prefixes.
