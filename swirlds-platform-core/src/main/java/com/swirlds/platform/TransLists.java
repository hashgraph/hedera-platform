/**
 * Store various lists of transactions created by self, both system and non-system, for wrapping in the next
 * Event to be created, and for immediate processing in the various SwirdState or SwirdState2 objects even
 * before being wrapped in an Event.
 *
 * These include a list of transactions to be added to the next Event that is created. They also include a
 * list of transactions by self to be handled by the stateCurr object immediately, so you can see the
 * results of your own actions right away, rather than having to wait until the next sync for them to become
 * visible to yourself. There is also a list for the stateWork object to handle. There is also a list for
 * the stateCons object, but it doesn't read from that list. It merely copies that list to the list for
 * stateWork whenever stateCons is copied to stateWork. And doCons also removes transactions from its list
 * when it sees them inside an event that has achieved consensus and is now being handled by stateCons. That
 * is because future stateWork objects will now reflect them as a result of copying the state, so they don't
 * need to be in this extra list of transactions any more.
