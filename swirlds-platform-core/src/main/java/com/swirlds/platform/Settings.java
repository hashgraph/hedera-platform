 * This purely-static class holds global settings that control how the Platform and sync processes operate.
 * If the file sdk/settings.txt exists, then it will read the settings from it, to override one or more of
 * the default settings (and to override settings in config.txt). The Browser should call the loadSettings()
 * method to read that file, before it instantiates any Platform objects (or anything else).
 *
 * Any field that is intended to be a "setting" should be non-final. The settings.txt file will not change
 * any of the fields. But it will change all of the final fields (except maxIncomingSyncs, which is a
 * special case which is calculated from maxOutgoingSyncs, and cannot be changed directly from
 * settings.txt).
 *
 * After the config.txt and settings.txt files have been read and the Platform objects instantiated, the
 * Browser should then call writeSettings() to write all the final settings values to settingsUsed.txt
 * (though only if settings.txt exists).
