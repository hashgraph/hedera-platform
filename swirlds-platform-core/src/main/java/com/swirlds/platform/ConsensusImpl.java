/**
 * All the code for calculating the consensus for events in a hashgraph. This calculates
 * the consensus timestamp and consensus order, according to the hashgraph consensus algorithm.
 *
 * Every method in this file is private, except for some getters and the addEvent method. Therefore,
 * if care is taken so that only one thread at a time can be in the call to addEvent, then only one
 * thread at a time will be anywhere in this is class (except for the getters). None of the variables
 * are volatile, so calls to the getters by other threads may not see effects of addEvent immediately.
 *
 * The consensus order is calculated incrementally: each time a new event is added to the hashgraph, it
 * immediately finds the consensus order for all the older events for which that is possible. It uses a
 * fundamental theorem that was not included in the tech report. That theorem is:
 *
 * Theorem: If every known witness in round R in hashgraph A has its fame decided by A, and S_{A,R} is the
 * set of known famous witnesses in round R in hashgraph A, and if at least one event created in round R+2
 * is known in A, then S_{A,R} is immutable and will never change as the hashgraph grows in the future.
 * Furthermore, any consistent hashgraph B will have an S_{B,R} that is a subset of S_{A,R}, and as B grows
 * during gossip, it will eventually be the case that S_{B,R} = S_{A,R} with probability one.
 *
 * Proof: the R+2 event strongly sees more than 2/3 of members having R+1 witnesses that vote NO on the fame
 * of any unknown R event X that will be discovered in the future. Any future R+2 voter will strongly see a
 * (possibly) different set of more than 2/3 of the R+1 population, and the intersection of the two sets
 * will all be NO votes for the new voter. So the new voter will see less than 1/3 YES votes, and more than
 * 1/3 NO votes, and will therefore vote no. Therefore every R+3 voter will see unanimous NO votes, and will
 * decide NO. Therefore X will not be famous. So the set of famous in R will never grow in the future. (And
 * so the consensus theorems imply that B will eventually agree).
 *
 * In other words, you never know whether new events and witnesses will be added to round R in the future.
 * But if all the known witnesses in that round have their fame decided (and if a round R+2 event is known),
 * then you know for sure that there will never be any more famous witnesses discovered for round R. So you
 * can safely calculate the received round and consensus time stamp for every event that will have a
 * received round of R. This is the key to the incremental algorithm: as soon as all known witnesses in R
 * have their fame decided (and there is at least one R+2 event), then we can decide the consensus for a new
 * batch of events: all those with received round R.
 *
 * There will be at least one famous event in each round. This is a theorem in the tech report, but both the
 * theorem and its proof should be adjusted to say the following:
 *
 * Definition: a "voter" is a witness in round R that is strongly seen by at least one witness in round R+1.
 *
 * Theorem: For any R, there exists a witness X in round R that will be famous, and this will be decided at
 * the latest when one event in round R+3 is known.
 *
 * Proof: Each voter in R+1 strongly sees more than 2n/3 witnesses in R, therefore each witness in R is on
 * average strongly seen by more than 2n/3 of the voters in R+1. There must be at least one that is not
 * below average, so let X be an R witness that is strongly seen by more than 2n/3 round R+1 voters. Those
 * voters will vote YES on the fame of X, because they see X. Any round R+2 witness will receive votes from
 * more than 2n/3 round R+1 voters, therefore it will receive a majority of its votes for X being YES,
 * therefore it will either vote or decide YES. If any R+2 witness decides, then X is known to be famous at
 * that time. If none do, then as soon as an R+3 witness exists, it will see unanimous YES votes, and it
 * will decide YES. So X will be known to be famous after the first witness of R+3 is known (or earlier).
 *
 * In normal operation, with everyone online and everyone honest, we might expect that all of the round R
 * witnesses will be known to be famous after the first event of round R+2 is known. But even in the worst
 * case, where some computers are down (even honest ones), and many dishonest members are forking, the
 * theorem still guarantees at least one famous witness is known by R+3.
 *
 * It is another theorem that the d12 and d2 algorithm have more than two thirds of the population creating
 * unique famous witnesses (judges) in each round. It is a theorem that d1 does, too, for the algorithmn described in
 * 2016, and is conjectured to be true for the 2019 version, too.
 *
 * Another new theorem used here:
 *
 * Theorem: If a new witness X is added to round R, but at least one already exists in round R+2, then X
 * will not be famous (so there is no need to hold the elections).
 *
 * Proof: If an event X currently exists in round R+2, then when the new event Y is added to round R, it
 * won't be an ancestor of X, nor of the witnesses that X strongly sees. Therefore, X will collect unanimous
 * votes of NO for the fame of Y, so X will decide that Y is not famous. Therefore, once a round R+2 event
 * is added to the hashgraph, the set of possible unique famous witnesses for round R is fixed, and the
 * unique famous witnesses will end up being a subset of it.
 *
 * NOTE: for concision, all of the above talks about things like "2/3 of the members" or "2/3 of the witnesses". In
 * every case, it should be interpreted to actually mean "members whose stake adds up to more than 2/3 of the total
 * stake", and "witnesses created by members whose stake is more than 2/3 of the total".
