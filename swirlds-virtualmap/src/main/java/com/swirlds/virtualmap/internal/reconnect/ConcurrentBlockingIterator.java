/**
 * This iterator was designed specifically for use with {@link VirtualRootNode} during reconnect on the
 * learner, but in concept could be adapted for more general use. This class enables a publisher/subscriber
 * approach to an iterator. New items are added via {@link #supply(Object, long, TimeUnit)}, while items are
 * consumed using {@link #next()}. {@link #hasNext()} will return true until there are no more items to
 * consume and will block if there are no items and {@link #close()} has not been called. Critically,
 * you must call {@link #close()} for the iterator to ever return {@code false} from {@link #hasNext()} or
 * throw {@link NoSuchElementException} from {@link #next()}. If new elements are supplied faster than they
 * are consumed, then {@link #supply(Object, long, TimeUnit)} will block until space becomes available. The
 * constructor allows you to define what the size of the inner buffer is.
