/**
 * Defines a data source, used with {@code VirtualMap}, to implement a virtual tree. Both in-memory and
 * on-disk data sources may be written. When constructing a {@code VirtualMap}, create a concrete data source
 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * The {@link VirtualDataSource} defines methods for getting the root node, and for looking up a leaf node
 * by key.
 * <p>
 * The nodes returned by the methods on this interface represent the *LATEST* state on disk. Once retrieved,
 * the nodes can be fast-copied for later versions, and persisted to disk via *archive*.
 * <p>
 * Each datasource instance works for a single type of K and V
 * <p>
 * <strong>YOU MUST NEVER ASK FOR SOMETHING YOU HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN.</strong> If you do, you will get
 * very strange exceptions. This is deemed acceptable because guarding against it would require obnoxious
 * performance degradation.

 * @param <K>
 * 		The key for a leaf node.
