This document contains example test configurations that developers have found useful.

If you build a configuration that you find useful, post it here so that others can use it.

========================================
===    How to add a configuration    ===
========================================

- Click the drop down menu in Intellij next to the green play button.
- Set the test kind to "Tags".
- Set the scope to "In whole project".
- Do not change the forking mode (default: none). Bug in intellij causes flags to be ignored if changed.
- Add a tag expression.

Tag expressions use standard Boolean logic:
- and using the “&” character
- or using the “|” character
- not using the “!” character
- (parentheses) are allowed
- Whitespace sensitive, do not add any spaces or other whitespace

Further tag documentation: https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-tag-expressions
