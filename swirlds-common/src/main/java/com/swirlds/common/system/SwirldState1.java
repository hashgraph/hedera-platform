/**
 * A {@link SwirldState} that may be updated by both pre-consensus and consensus transactions and
 * remains mutable after being copied.
 *
 * <p>If an app's state class implements SwirldState1, then the platform will instantiate it to
 * create a state object X, and will transactions to it by calling X.handleTransaction() and
 * X.handleConsensusRound(). Each transaction is sent to X only once.
 *
 * <p>First the Platform will give X one or more rounds of consensus ordered transactions by calling
 * X .handleConsensusRound(). Then it will make a fast copy of X, creating a new object Y. Then it
 * will send X multiple transactions that have not yet reached consensus by calling
 * X.handleTransaction(). Eventually, it will stop sending transactions to X, and switch to sending
 * transactions to Y. It will start by sending multiple transactions that were pre-consensus when
 * they were sent to X, but now have reached consensus when they are sent to Y. In this way, any
 * particular state object will see each transaction only once, and the platform frequently makes
 * fast copies of the objects. The computer may handle each transaction multiple times, but any
 * particular object only handles it once. This is useful, because it lets the app respond to
 * transactions even before they have a consensus order, but then can re-respond appropriately when
 * that order changes. The app doesn't have to be written specially to deal with this changing
 * history. The Platform takes care of managing all the version control as the order of history
 * keeps changing.

     * also OK if the handle methods spawn a number of threads that change those variables, then
     * wait until all those threads have ended, and then return. It is even OK for a handle method
     * to create a pool of threads that continue to exist after it returns, as long as it ensures
     * that those threads have finished all their changes before it returns. But it is an error for
     * a handle method to spawn a thread that will make changes after the handle method returns and
     * before the next time a handle method is called. If any of the handle methods create threads
     * that continue to exist after it returns (in a legal way), then it should clean up those
     * resources when the object has been fully released (see documentation in {@link Releasable}).
     * If the SwirldState extends one of the partial merkle implementations (e.g. PartialMerkleLeaf
     * or PartialNaryMerkleInternal) then it can put that cleanup in the onDestroy() method, which
     * is called when the object becomes fully released.
