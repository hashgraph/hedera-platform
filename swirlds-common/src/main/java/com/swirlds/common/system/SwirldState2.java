 * for {@link SwirldState1} (though it will still make some fast copies, for other reasons). An app implementing
 * {@link SwirldState2} does not have the ability to affect its state or the shared state with pre-consensus
 * transactions. If there is a need to actually show their effect on the state, then it must implement {@link
