 * A Swirld app is defined by creating two classes, one implementing {@link SwirldMain}, and the
 * other {@link SwirldState}, such that: <br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code SwirldState} has a no-argument constructor (called by {@link Platform})
 *   <li>All {@code SwirldState} variables are thread-safe and private
 *   <li>All {@code SwirldState} methods are synchronized
 *   <li>{@code SwirldMain} never modifies an object in {@code SwirldState}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <br>
 * So, if {@code SwirldState} contains an array, and {@code SwirldMain} gets it through a getter
 * method, then the developer is responsible for making sure {@code SwirldMain} never changes the
 * contents of that array. Or the getter can simply return a deep copy of the array instead of the
 * original.
