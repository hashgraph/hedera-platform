/**
 * A SelfSerializable object that can also be serialized in an abbreviated form.
 *
 * When a SerializableAbbreviated object is serialized in its complete form (using the serialize/deserialize methods)
 * all data required to reconstruct the object is stored within the data stream.
 *
 * When a SerializableAbbreviated object is serialized in its abbreviated form, a portion of the data may be
 * propagated over other caller controlled channels (i.e. a file on a disk or a blob in a database).
 * The data that is written to the stream while in abbreviated form must contain all information required
 * locate the data required to reconstruct the object.
 *
 * The hash of the SerializableAbbreviated object is automatically serialized and deserialized when it is
 * sent over a stream in abbreviated form. If external data is large and expensive to hash, this allows
 * for a SerializableAbbreviated instance to verify that the expected hash matches a pre-computed hash
 * of the external data (as opposed to recomputing it every time). Caching of hash values should be done
 * if and only if the authenticity of the external data is beyond reproach. This may be appropriate when
 * the data is stored on a local disk with sufficient physical and digital security. This is definitely not
 * appropriate if the external data is loaded over a network.
