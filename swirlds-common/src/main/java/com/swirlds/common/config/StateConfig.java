/**
 * Config that control the SignedStateManager and SignedStateFileManager behaviors.
 *
 * @param savedStateDirectory The directory where states are saved. This is relative to the current
 *     working directory, unless the provided path begins with "/", in which case it will be
 *     interpreted as an absolute path.
 * @param mainClassNameOverride Typically, the fully qualified name of the application class
 *     implementing {@link com.swirlds.common.system.SwirldMain SwirldMain} is used as a directory
 *     name when saving signed states. If this property is not the empty string then it overrides
 *     the main class name for signed states.
 * @param cleanSavedStateDirectory If true, clean out all data in the {@link #savedStateDirectory}
 *     except for the previously saved state.
 * @param stateSavingQueueSize The number of states permitted to sit in the signed state file
 *     manager's queue of states being written. If this queue backs up then some states may not be
 *     written to disk.
 * @param saveStatePeriod The frequency of writes of a state to disk every this many seconds (0 to
 *     never write).
 * @param signedStateDisk Keep at least this many of the old complete signed states on disk. This
 *     should be at least 2 so that we don't delete an old state while a new one is in the process
 *     of writing to disk. set to 0 to not keep any states to disk.
 * @param dumpStateOnAnyISS If true, save the state to disk when an ISS is detected. May negatively
 *     affect the performance of the node where the ISS occurs. This feature is for debugging
 *     purposes and should not be active in production systems.
 * @param dumpStateOnFatal If true, then save the state to disk when there is a fatal exception.
 * @param haltOnAnyIss
 *     <p>Halt this node whenever any ISS in the network is detected. A halt causes the node to stop
 *     doing work, but does not shut down the JVM.
 *     <p>This feature is for debugging purposes only. Enabling this feature in production
 *     environments enables a very simple denial of service attack on the network.
 * @param automatedSelfIssRecovery If true, then attempt to recover automatically when a self ISS is
 *     detected.
 * @param haltOnCatastrophicIss If true, then halt this node if a catastrophic ISS is detected. A
 *     halt causes the node to stop doing work, but does not shut down the JVM.
 * @param secondsBetweenISSDumps If one ISS is detected, it is likely that others will be detected
 *     shortly afterwards. Specify the minimum time, in seconds, that must transpire after dumping a
 *     state before another state dump is permitted. Ignored if dumpStateOnISS is false.
 * @param secondsBetweenIssLogs The minimum time that must pass between log messages about ISS
 *     events. If ISS events happen with a higher frequency then they are squelched.
 * @param stateDeletionErrorLogFrequencySeconds If there are problems with state lifecycle then
 *     write errors to the log at most once per this period of time.
 * @param enableHashStreamLogging When enabled, hashes for the nodes are logged per round.
 * @param backgroundHashChecking If true then a single background thread is used to do validation of
 *     signed state hashes. Validation is on a best effort basis. If it takes too long to validate a
 *     state then new states will be skipped.
 * @param debugHashDepth When logging debug information about the hashes in a merkle tree, do not
 *     display hash information for nodes deeper than this.
 * @param maxAgeOfFutureStateSignatures It's possible to receive state signatures before it's time
 *     to process the round signed by the signature. This is the maximum number of rounds, in the
 *     future, for which a node will accept a state signature.
 * @param roundsToKeepForSigning The maximum number of rounds that a state will be kept in memory
 *     while waiting for it to gather enough signatures. If a state becomes fully signed prior to
 *     reaching this age it may be removed from memory.
 * @param signedStateSentinelEnabled If true, then enable extra debug code that tracks signed
 *     states. Very useful for debugging state leaks. This debug code is relatively expensive (it
 *     takes and stores stack traces when operations are performed on signed state objects).
