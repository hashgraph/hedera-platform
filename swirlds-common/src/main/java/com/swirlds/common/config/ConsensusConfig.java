/**
 * Configuration for the consensus algorithm
 *
 * @param roundsNonAncient The number of consensus rounds that are defined to be non-ancient. There
 *     can be more non-ancient rounds, but these rounds will not have reached consensus. Once
 *     consensus is reached on a new round (i.e.,fame is decided for all its witnesses), another
 *     round will become ancient. Events, whose generation is older than the last non-ancient round
 *     generation, are ancient. If they don't have consensus yet, they're stale, and will never
 *     reach consensus and never have their transactions handled.
 * @param roundsExpired Events this many rounds old are expired, and can be deleted from memory
 * @param coinFreq a coin round happens every coinFreq rounds during an election (every other one is
 *     all true)
