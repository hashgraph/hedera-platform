	 * Given a transaction, update the state to reflect its effect. A given SwirldState object will see a
	 * sequence of transactions consisting of some number for which <code>consensus</code> is true, followed
	 * by the rest being false. The transactions for which it is true are sent in the consensus order. The
	 * rest are sent in an order that is the current best guess as to what the consensus will be. But that
	 * order is subject to change. A given SwirldState object will never see that order change. But a
	 * different SwirldState object may be instantiated by the Platform, and it may receive those
	 * transactions in a different order.
	 * <p>
	 * The address parameter will usually be null. When it isn't, this transaction is a request that a new
	 * member be added to the address book. The new member's information is passed in as
	 * <code>address</code>, and the member who is inviting them has ID number <code>id</code> (or -1 if the
	 * config.txt file is "inviting" them).
	 * <p>
	 * For such invitations, the transaction <code>trans</code> might be null. Or it might describe
	 * something relevant to the invitation, such as what privileges the invitor gives the inviteee. Or
	 * perhaps some fraction of the invitor's resources to be given to the invitee. This method is
	 * responsible for deciding whether to add the invitee to the address book, to make the addition (or
	 * not), and to update the state accordingly (such as by transferring resources from inviter to
	 * invitee).
	 * <p>
	 * The state of this object must NEVER change except inside the methods init(), SwirldState.copyFrom(),
	 * FastCopyable.copyFrom(), and handleTransaction(). So it is good if handleTransaction changes some of
	 * the class variables and then returns. It is also OK if handleTransactions spawns a number of threads
	 * that change those variables, then waits until all those threads have ended, and then returns. It is
	 * even OK for it to create a pool of threads that continue to exist after handleTransaction returns, as
	 * long as it ensures that those threads have finished all their changes before it returns. But it is an
	 * error for handleTransaction to spawn a thread that will make changes after handleTransaction returns
	 * and before the next time handleTransaction is called. If handleTransaction does create threads that

	 * Normally, an app must define a state class that implements SwirldState. The Platform then sends
	 * transactions to it, where any given transaction is only sent once. The app could instead implement
	 * SwirldState2, which is identical, except that the Platform will send each transaction twice. If the
	 * app should respond to transactions immediately, even before their consensus order is known, then it
	 * should implement SwirldState. If it is acceptable to wait until consensus has been found before each
	 * transaction is processed, then the app can implement either SwirldState or SwirldState2, and the
	 * latter will be more efficient, reducing the amount of computation. If the former is implemented, then
	 * the app can allow non-consensus actions to change the shared state. If the latter is implemented,
	 * then it must not. The following describes what is happening in more detail.
	 * <p>
	 * If an app's state class implements SwirldState, then the platform will instantiate it to create a
	 * state object X, and will send transactions to it by calling X.handleTransaction(). Each transaction
	 * is sent to X only once. First the Platform will give X multiple transactions where consensus is true.
	 * Then it will make a fast copy of X, creating a new object Y. Then it will send X multiple
	 * transactions where consensus is false. Eventually, it will stop sending transactions to X, and switch
	 * to sending transactions to Y. It will start by sending multiple transactions that had consensus=false
	 * when they were sent to X, but now have consensus=true when they are sent to Y. In this way, any
	 * particular state object will see each transaction only once, and the platform frequently makes fast
	 * copies of the objects. The computer may handle each transaction multiple times, but any particular
	 * object only handles it once. This is useful, because it lets the app respond to transactions even
	 * before they have a consensus order, but then can re-respond appropriately when that order changes.
	 * The app doesn't have to be written specially to deal with this changing history. The Platform takes
	 * care of managing all the version control as the order of history keeps changing.
	 * <p>
	 * If an app's state class implements SwirldState2, then the Platform treats it differently. It will
	 * instantiate an object X, and send it every transaction twice. The first time it sends a transaction
	 * T, it will have consensus=false, and the second time it sends T, it will have consensus = true. Some
	 * transactions might only be sent once (with consensus=true), but most will be sent twice. The sequence
	 * of transactions will go back and forth between consensus being true and false, rather than having all
	 * true followed by all false. When using SwirldState2, the Platform does not have to make frequent fast
	 * copies of the state (though it will still make some fast copies, for other reasons). An app
	 * implementing SwirldState2 must either completely ignore the transactions with consensus=false, or
	 * handle them specially so that they don't affect the shared state. If there is a need to actually show
	 * their effect on the state, then it will be easier to implement SwirldState. But if it is acceptable
	 * to delay the effect until consensus, then SwirldState2 may be more efficient.
