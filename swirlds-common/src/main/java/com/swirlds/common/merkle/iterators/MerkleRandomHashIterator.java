/**
 * Iterate over a merkle tree in a post-order depth first search. Instead of visiting children
 * from left to right, children are visited in a randomized order. Will make a best effort
 * attempt not to visit nodes that have already been hashed.
 *
 * This iteration strategy is extremely useful for bottom-up algorithms where the result from one subtree
 * does not influence the result from another subtree. Parallel threads can perform work on the tree, and with
 * high probability they will not collide with each other. This strategy has been useful to compute hashes
 * of a tree with many threads in parallel.
