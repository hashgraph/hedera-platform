/**
 * Configuration for the reconnect.
 *
 * @param active Determines what a node will do when it falls behind. If true, it will attempt a
 *     reconnect, if false, it will die. Is reconnect enabled?
 * @param reconnectWindowSeconds Defines a window of time after the node starts up when the node is
 *     allowed to reconnect. If -1 then a node is always allowed to reconnect. Respects {@link
 *     #active} -- if active is false then reconnect is never allowed.
 * @param fallenBehindThreshold The fraction of neighbors needed to tell us we have fallen behind
 *     before we initiate a reconnect.
 * @param asyncStreamTimeoutMilliseconds The amount of time that an {@link
 *     com.swirlds.common.merkle.synchronization.streams.AsyncInputStream} and {@link
 *     com.swirlds.common.merkle.synchronization.streams.AsyncOutputStream} will wait before
 *     throwing a timeout.
 * @param asyncOutputStreamFlushMilliseconds In order to ensure that data is not languishing in the
 *     asyncOutputStream buffer a periodic flush is performed.
 * @param asyncStreamBufferSize The size of the buffers for async input and output streams.
 * @param asyncStreams If false then the async streams behave as if they were synchronous.
 *     Significantly effects performance, should be true unless the async streams are being
 *     debugged.
 * @param maxAckDelayMilliseconds The maximum amount of time to wait for an ACK message. If no ACK
 *     is received and sufficient time passes then send the potentially redundant node.
 * @param maximumReconnectFailuresBeforeShutdown The maximum number of failed reconnects in a row
 *     before shutdown.
 * @param minimumTimeBetweenReconnects The minimum time that must pass before a node is willing to
 *     help another node to reconnect another time. This prevents a node from intentionally or
 *     unintentionally slowing another node down by continuously reconnecting with it. Time is
 *     measured starting from when a reconnect attempt is initialized.
